## The Art of The Solution

API Management can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people.

Is it the consolidation of public APIs under a single umbrella? Is it unifying security and standardizing access to internal APIs? Is it an effort to streamline your developers' efforts and let them build out underlying microservices without worrying about authentication and authorization?

As a Solutions Architect, my goal is to make sure that clients understand the value of API management- and what benefits it might bring to their respective organizations. My audience ranges from engineering wizards who could regurgitate the Fast Inverse Square Root algorithm from Quake all the way to C-Level executives who are more interested in outcomes versus outputs. This means that on any given day- I could be deep in the weeds going over the OAuth Dance or illustrating how ****\_\_\_\_****

So, what is the best approach to architecting the solution? Frustratingly enough, the answer is **it depends**. It doesn't matter how good your product is, if your audience doesn't understand it.

That can mean as hands-on or as hands-off as possible.

How would you guarantee little to no downtime to your current API consumers while you migrate?

It becomes more of an educational exercise,

Whether that means

Solutions architecting is about finding a balance from
