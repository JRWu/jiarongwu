# Consistency is Key

People buy from people. It doesn't matter if you have the best technical product amongst your competitors or the most impressive features- if you can't convey the benefits to your customers, you won't close. Therefore, the technical demo is crucial for first impressions and the resultant proof of concept (PoC).

In your organization, how do you know if your demo process works? How might you quantify the impact of demonstrating novel features? If close rate is your dependent variable what are the independent variables that you can manipulate to boost it?

These reasons, amongst others, led me to develop a framework in which you can model the effectiveness and empirically measure the impact of the technical demo. At the core of this process is a consistent demo environment, for example: [Tyk-Demo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-demo). Tyk-Demo is a repository where users can spin up the [Tyk API Management Stack](https://tyk.io/) and specify various deployments and features. Since it's a docker-composed based demo that leverages APIs to bootstrap data- it is consistent across platforms, and provides a foundation for the demo.

- Illustrate outcomes (describe with fluff here)
